Changes in metafor version 1.0-1 (2010-01-28; released on CRAN)

   o version jump in conjunction with publication of paper in 
     the Journal of Statistical Software describing the package
   o instead of specifying a design matrix, the user can 
     now specify a model formula for the mods argument in the 
     rma() function (e.g., like in the lm() function)
   o permutest() function now allows exact permutation tests
     (but this is only feasible when k is not too large)
   o forest() function now uses the level argument properly to 
     adjust the CI level of the summary estimate for models
     without moderators (i.e., fixed- and random-effets models)
   o forest() function can now also show the credibility interval
     as a dashed line for a random-effects model
   o information about the 'measure' used is now passed on to 
     the forest() and funnel() functions, which try to set an 
     appropriate x axis title accordingly
   o funnel function now has more arguments (e.g., atransf, at)
     providing control over the display of the x axis
   o predict() function now has its own print method and has a
     new argument (addx), which adds the values of the moderator 
     variables to the returned object (when addx=TRUE)
   o functions now properly handle the na.action "na.pass" 
     (treated essentially like "na.exclude")
   o added method for weights() function to extract the weights
     used when fitting models with rma.uni()
   o some small improvements to the documentation

Changes in metafor version 0.5-7 (2009-12-06; released on CRAN)

   o added permutest() function for permutation tests
   o added metafor.news() function to display the NEWS file
     of the metafor package within R (based on the same idea
     in the animate package by Yihui Xie)
   o added some checks for values below machine precision
   o a bit of code reorganization (nothing that affects how
     the functions work)

Changes in metafor version 0.5-6 (2009-10-19)

   o small changes to the computation of the DFFITS and DFBETAS 
     values in the influence() function, so that these statistics 
     are more in line with their definitions in regular linear 
     regression models
   o added option to the plot function for objects returned by
     influence() to allow plotting the covariance ratios on a 
     log scale (now the default)
   o slight adjustments to various print() functions (to catch
     some errors when certain values were NA)
   o added a control option to rma() to adjust the step length of
     the Fisher scoring algorithm by a constant factor (this may
     be useful when the algorithm does not converge)

Changes in metafor version 0.5-5 (2009-10-08; released on CRAN)

   o added the phi coefficient (measure="PHI"), Yule's Q ("YUQ"),
     and Yule's Y ("YUY") as additional measures to the escalc() 
     function for 2x2 table data
   o forest plots now order the studies so that the first study
     is at the top of the plot and the last study at the bottom
     (the order can still be set with the order/subset arguments)
   o added cumul() function for cumulative meta-analyses (with a
     corresponding forest() method to plot the cumulative results)
   o added leave1out() function for leave-one-out diagnostics
   o added option to qqnorm.rma.uni() so that the user can choose
     whether to apply the Bonferroni correction to the bounds of
     the pseudo confidence envelope
   o some internal changes to the class and methods names
   o some small corrections to the documentation

Changes in metafor version 0.5-4 (2009-09-18; released on CRAN)

   o corrected the trimfill() function
   o improvements to various print functions
   o added a regtest() function for various regression tests of
     funnel plot asymmetry (e.g., Egger's regression test)
   o made ranktest() generic and added a method for objects of 
     class "rma" so that the test can be carried out after fitting
   o added anova() function for full vs reduced model comparisons
     via fit statistics and likelihood ratio tests
   o added the Orwin and Rosenberg approaches to fsn()
   o added H^2 measure to the output for random-effects models
   o in escalc(), measure="COR" is now used for the (usual) raw
     correlation coefficient and measure="UCOR" for the bias
     corrected correlation coefficients
   o some small corrections to the documentation

Changes in metafor version 0.5-3 (2009-07-31; released on CRAN)

   o small changes to some of the examples
   o added the log transformed proportion (measure="PLN") as another 
     measure to the escalc() function; changed "PL" to "PLO" for the 
     logit (i.e., log odds) transformation for proportions

Changes in metafor version 0.5-2 (2009-07-06)

   o added an option in plot.infl.rma.uni() to open a new device 
     for plotting the DFBETAS values
   o thanks to Jim Lemon, added a much better method of adjusting 
     the size of the labels, annotations, and symbols in the forest() 
     function when the number of studies is large

Changes in metafor version 0.5-1 (2009-06-14)

   o made some small changes to the documentation (some typos 
     corrected, some confusing points clarified)

First version released on CRAN: 0.5-0 (2009-06-05)
